I choose Azure App Service for following reasons:

1.Azure VMs are more expensive to run in comparison to Azure App Service.

2.Azure App Service requires much less managerial efforts in comparison to Azure Virtual Machines.

3.The development of app is much simpler and faster in Azure App Service.

4.Azure App service takes away some of the additional responsibilities of customer, and gives it back to cloud provider, 
  for which customer is responsible while working with Azure VMs.
